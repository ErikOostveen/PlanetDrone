<br/>&#9642; Introduction

Sound has a powerful effect on the brain and can be used as a tool to relax and destress. When we listen to soothing sounds, our brain waves slow down, leading to a state of relaxation. This can be particularly useful for individuals who struggle with anxiety, stress, and insomnia.

One way that sound relaxes the brain is through the process of entrainment. This refers to the tendency of our brain waves to sync up with external rhythms, such as the sound of music or the sound of ocean waves. When we listen to these kinds of rhythmic sounds, our brain waves naturally slow down and become more synchronized, leading to a state of relaxation.

Another way that sound relaxes the brain is through its ability to distract us from our thoughts and worries. When we focus on a pleasant sound, such as the sound of a waterfall or the sound of a favorite piece of music, it can help to draw our attention away from any negative or stressful thoughts that may be occupying our minds. This can be especially helpful for individuals who tend to ruminate or worry excessively.

In addition to its ability to relax the brain, sound can also have a number of other beneficial effects on our physical and mental well-being. For example, research has shown that listening to music can lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate, and even boost the immune system. It can also help to improve our mood, increase feelings of happiness and pleasure, and even reduce the perception of pain.

Overall, the relaxing power of sound is undeniable. Whether it's through entrainment, distraction, or any of its other beneficial effects, sound can be a powerful tool for helping us to relax and de-stress. So the next time you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious, consider turning on some soothing sounds and letting them work their magic on your brain.

&#9642; Summary

Planet Drone is an Open Source Raspberry PI Eurorack-Module project, which uses the <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a> platform to generate distinctive and captivating music drones.

Planet Drone consists of a triad of complementary, electronically-identical, Eurorack modules each wielding a unique set of extraordinary music drones (patches).

On power-up, the module selects a random patch for you to enjoy listening to and manipulate using the four encoder knobs. Multiply this drone-power by 3 (i.e. 3 modules) and you can imagine the wonderful soundscapes you can create!

Each module comes with a selection of patches written in the SuperCollider real time audio synthesis programming language (sclang). If you are up for a challengem you can edit existing patches or even write your own.

Collect or build all three modules and get droning!
